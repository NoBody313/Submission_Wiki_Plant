        "Known for its vibrant foliage and long bloom times, the Abelia genus consists of about 30 species of both deciduous and evergreen shrubs. There has been much discussion about the Abelia genus itself, since modern DNA testing has proved that some previously recognized members of the genus were substantially different. Various horticultural experts recognize different nomenclature structures, either reducing the size of the Abelia genus or reclassifying these species as members of the Linnea genus.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For shrubs commonly known as abelia, there are several common identifiers. These shrubs produce pointed, oval-shaped leaves that are often yellow or green with pink, orange, bronze, or burgundy details. Some are multi-colored or variegated and even change color as the seasons change. Their flowers are tubular and are often seen in white, pink, or yellow. Unlike many flowering plants, abelia shrubs have a long blooming season that extends from spring until fall.",
        "The Acoma crape myrtle is a hybrid variety of the Lagerstroemia, most frequently known by its common name the crape (or crepe) myrtle. This particular variety only attains a height of up to 10 to 15 feet or so and is frequently reported as staying small in size and being more shrub-like instead of appearing like a tree. It grows by about 1 to 2 feet per year.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The crape myrtle is a great option for planting in urban or suburban environments. Its small size makes it ideal for gardens or lawns, or it can be used as part of a commercial landscaping plan. Before planting, make sure that the full grown tree won't cause issues on the property since the tree cannot be topped. You cannot cut off the top of the tree to control the height; that will kill the tree (\"crape murder,\" as it's known).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In addition, this cultivar demonstrates greater resistance to powdery mildew—a frequent problem with some crape myrtle trees.",
        "Aeonium is a genus including about 35 succulent plant species with unusually glossy, waxy leaves arranged in rosettes. The species range from the low-growing A. tabuliforme and A. smithii that grow just a few inches across, to larger species that grow several feet across, such as A. arboreum, A. valverdense, and A. holochrysum.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The rounded leaves of the rosette structures are so perfect that these species are sometimes mistaken for artificial plants. These signature rosettes can be a solid color or variegated in white, yellow, red, and green. Small, star-like flowers grow in clusters from the center of the rosettes, but they are not particularly showy.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Aeoniums can be planted in the garden at any time. These are rather slow-growing plants, and it may take as much as five years before they produce the little bunches of flowers from the center of the rosettes. Most aeoniums are monocarpic, meaning that the mother plant dies after flowering, but the pups (shoots) will continue to produce more shoots, as well.",
        "The Aerangis genus comprises many tropical orchids which can be distinguished by their lovely white, star-shaped flowers. The genus contains about 50 plants, and though they mostly originate in tropical regions of Africa, a few are also native to the islands of the Indian ocean. Aerangis orchids, though uncommon in cultivation, are not overly difficult to grow, even by novices. However, they don't react well to sudden environmental changes, and like all orchids, plants are often lost to sudden changes in temperature or humidity.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Typically, these orchids are epiphytes—plants that grow attached to trees rather than in soil—and they’re often grown in hanging baskets filled with bark chip/ sphagnum moss mixture. The best and most distinctive feature of an Aerangis plant is its waxy flowers, which are usually white or yellow and shaped like five-pointed stars. Not only do these flowers give off a pleasant aroma, but they also bloom with regularity.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A single Aerangis specimen can bear many flowers at once. Their leaves are evergreen, and their spurs contain nectar that is pleasing to birds. Despite their relative rarity, several species of Aerangis plants, such as A. citrata, are sometimes grown by hobbyists, and there are also a few hybrids available to orchid aficionados and botanical experts. Gardeners who can mimic the tropical conditions in which the Aerangis orchid thrives will want to consider this understated and pleasant genus.",
        "African daisies (Osteospermum spp.) look a lot like common daisies, with petals radiating around a center disk. They are even members of the Asteraceae family, along with Shasta daisies and zinnias. But their vivid coloring is not at all like the classic daisy. In fact, when African daisies were first introduced to the market, some people thought they must have been dyed. The center disks of the flowers even can look like they're colored with metallic paint. Petals may be smooth and flat like a typical daisy, or radiate out in a tubular spoon shape. The leaves vary by variety; they can be lance-like or broadly ovate and smooth, toothed, or lobed.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "These flowers are best planted in the spring after the threat of frost has passed, and they have a fairly quick growth rate, blooming about two months after sprouting from seeds. Reliably hardy in zones 10 to 11, these tender perennials are planted as annuals in other climate zones. While there are more than 70 species in the genus, most African daisies sold in the trade are cultivars and hybrids derived from O. ecklonis, O. jucundum, and a few other species.",
        "African fern pine is a conifer with long, narrow leaves, native to eastern Africa. In appropriate North American climates, it can be used as a moderately tall landscape tree, but it also accepts hard pruning and is sometimes used as a hedge plant.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Originally assigned the botanical name Podocarpus gracilior, the fern pine has been reclassified as Afrocarpus gracilior by some botanists. The fern pine is still generally sold under the name of Podocarpus gracilior, and literature may still refer to it by the former scientific name.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The fern pine produces clusters of slender light green leaves that darken as they mature. The evergreen leaves are irregularly spaced and grow up to 4 inches in length at maturity. It is the airy, fern-like appearance of the foliage that makes this a desirable tree or hedge shrub. The flowers of this species are yellow and not conspicuous. Instead of a traditional cone, the tree produces a small fleshy fruit containing a single seed. The berry-like fruits are green in color, turning to yellow as they ripen.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Fern pines develop a single upright trunk with a dense canopy that, when properly trimmed, produces a rounded or oval shape. When allowed to grow in tree form, it will eventually reach a height of up to 60 feet. Over time it will spread to a width of 25 to 35 feet, casting dense shade. The trunk will grow to a size of 2 feet or more in diameter. If kept as a shrub or hedge, the fern pine is usually clipped so it does not exceed a height of 20 feet. Young specimens have even been successfully trained as wall espaliers.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "African fern pine has a moderate growth rate that will add 12 to 36 inches a year, and it can be quite long-lived, surviving up to 150 years.",
        "Hailing from Southeast Asia, Amazonian elephant's ear is a popular tropical plant. It's a hybrid varietal that makes a striking and beautiful houseplant and is typically sold as such. It can be purchased, planted, and cared for year-round in an indoor environment.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Amazonian elephant's ear is defined by its deep green leaves, which are accentuated by whitish or light green veins. The leaves are roughly serrated, and in some cases, the leaf color appears as an almost purple-green. The plant will grow quickly, reaching a mature height of up to 2 feet. Amazonian elephant ear plants rarely bloom (especially indoors), and are grown primarily for their eye-catching foliage. ",
        "African milk tree (Euphorbia trigona) is native to Central Africa. It is often grown as a hedge due to its rapid and enthusiastic growth. This plant looks a lot like a cactus—hence its nicknames: candelabra cactus, cathedral cactus, friendship cactus, and good luck cactus—but it is actually a succulent plant. It features triangular stems, with three distinct sides seamed with ridges. The ridges are peppered with thorns and tear dropped-shaped leaves. This plant stays lush and green throughout its growing season, with new growth sprouting a light green hue. The Rubra or Royal Red cultivar is popular for its dramatic color, taking on bright red accents late in the season.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Like a cactus, African milk tree lives a long life and grows vigorously—approximately 1 to 2 feet a year up to 9 feet tall. But when grown indoors, this plant will only grow to about half of its maximum height. Only North American gardeners in states with arid climates—where the temperatures at night stay above 50 F (parts of Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona)—can grow African milk tree outdoors. For these lucky few, the plant provides a dramatic landscape addition not often seen in gardens throughout the United States.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The sap of the African milk tree is toxic to both pets and humans and can be irritating to the skin, eyes, and mouth. So much so that it can cause blisters, severe eye irritation, and, if swallowed, can sometimes result in convulsions.",
        "The African spear plant (Sansevieria cylindrica), also known as the cylindrical snake plant, is a succulent that consists of upright, gray-green, subtly striped leaves. The leaves are cylindrical in shape but narrow to a point at their tips. When grown in optimal conditions, African spear plants might send up a long flower spike from their center that's full of tiny, delicate, white blooms. They are best planted at the start of the growing season in the spring, and they’re generally a slow-growing succulent. ",
        "Peperomia plants belong to a wonderful genus of tropical plants native to Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean. With more than 1,000 known species, these hearty plants boast thick, fleshy leaves that contribute to their drought tolerance and vigor.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "If you haven't experienced much luck with flowering houseplants, you will appreciate that the Peperomia sports ornamental foliage. Its leaves can be textured or smooth in red, green, gray, or purple; variegated, marbled, or solid; large, heart-shaped, or tiny.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Plants in the Peperomia genus can look so different from one to the next that it's difficult to discern if they are even related. All Peperomia plants are low maintenance, slow-growing, and can be planted all year long.",
        "Baby's tears (Soleirolia soleirolii) is a mat-forming tropical perennial with myriad tiny leaves. Often confused as a type of moss, it comes from the nettle family. What makes baby's tears special is its dense, delicate mat of fine round or bean-shaped leaves on short, fleshy stems. Baby's tears plants are easy to grow for beginners, but they require regular attention to look their best.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "It thrives in lower-light conditions and is commonly used in terrariums and mixed containers. In warmer climates, it's grown outdoors as an evergreen ground cover or filler plant for rock gardens. In colder zones, if planted outdoors, it's an annual that dies out as the winter season starts. This fast-growing plant is easy to grow from potted nursery plants in the spring. Although, it is an invasive plant in warmer, tropical climates.",
        "These adorable succulents truly live up to their nickname: Baby toes succulents (Fenestraria rhopalophylla) are small, clump-forming succulents that are native to Namibia and South Africa. They are classified as window-leafed succulents because the top of their tube-shaped leaves are transparent due to a lack of green pigment that allows light to pass through the thick, fleshy tubes. Adding to their attractive nature, these succulents produce delicate white or yellow flowers in the spring and fall. "
